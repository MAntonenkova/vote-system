Vote System project - voting system to decide where to have lunch
--------------------------------------------------------------------

REST API using Hibernate/Spring/SpringMVC (or Spring-Boot) without frontend

- 2 types of users: admin and regular users
- Admin can input a restaurant and its lunch menu of the day (2-5 items usually, just a dish name and price)
- Menu changes each day (admins do the updates)
- Users can vote on which restaurant they want to have lunch at
- Only one vote counted per user
- If user votes again the same day:
    1. If it is before 11:00 we asume that he changed his mind.
    2. If it is after 11:00 then it is too late, vote can't be changed
- Each restaurant provides new menu each day
